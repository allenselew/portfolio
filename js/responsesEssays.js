These relationships in turn may affect the nature of the elements themselves, as well as their relationships with other elements. For instance, a high school's student community is a system. The elements are comprised of the students, their grades, the classes they take, etc. The relationships between students and other students, students and their grades, and students and their classes may influence both the students and those other relationships in turn. If Cindy and Jack start dating, it may affect how Louis feels towards Jack. If Kyle starts skipping class with Johnny, his relationship with his grades may take a turn for the worse while his relationship with Johnny becomes better. The key property of a system that makes it different from a random heterogeneous collection of things is the relationships between elements.</p><p>Looking at this high school system from an analytic or reductionist perspective, you see many of the key elements like Cindy, Jack, Kyle's grades and Johnny. Unfortunately, you fail to notice the relationships between these things, which a systems perspective would offer. A systems perspective thus complements an analytic approach by giving it a wider view of how the entire system would change if any of the individual elements were changed themselves.</p><p>Meadows mentions \"stocks\" and \"flows\" which correlate well with elements and their relationships. The stocks are the current tangible or intangible elements in their entirety. An example may be a student's stock of pencils. The flows represent the changes in those stocks over time. Flows may come from one stock and lead to another inside of the system or conversely, may end up entirely outside of the system as well. Sometimes, these flows follow loops that affect the same stocks they flow from. These loops are called feedback loops and work to either help stocks maintain balance, grow, or decline consistently by pushing stocks in one direction or another. </p><p>A great example of a feedback loop that maintains balance is in the body's homeostasic systems. When your body's internal temperature stocks drop too low, your body automatically shivers to create a flow of heat that will raise your temperature stock back to normal. Likewise, when your body's temperature stocks are too high, you may sweat to draw heat out of your body and have it evaporate into the air. Using both negative and positive feedback loops, your body balances itself. A stock that grows consistently may be your bank account, which based on the principal investment grows with compound interest regularly over time. A stock that decreases consistently may be the number of baby teeth a child has, decreasing until none are left and the stock reaches 0.</p><p>Relating this with information technology and information systems, I definitely see the advantages of viewing information as living in an ecosystem.  A systems perspective allows one to understand how the moving pieces work together and better adapt when a piece crashes or needs to be replaced in function by a different piece. The relationships between people and technology are at the heart of information technology and without considering those relationships, it would be difficult to make a successful product. Furthermore, when thinking of managing databases and information systems, which are perhaps the most clear-cut stocks of information, it is important to manage the flows of insertion and deletion. An overflow one way or the other would certainly be overwhelming.</p>"
